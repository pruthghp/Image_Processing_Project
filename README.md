# Number Plate Recognition using the techniques and principles of Image Processing
•	A Smart Number Plate Recognition System that uses the concept of Optical Character Recognition and Character-Template Correlation to identify and aggregate characters quickly and automatically from the captured number plate.
•	Uses different image processing techniques such as Sobel edge detection, thresholding, bounding box method to localize and enhance the vehicle number plate from the captured image.
•	Uses concepts like Segmentation, Optical Character Recognition, Template Matching and Character Aggregation to produce the Vehicle Number as the output from the localized image of the plate accurately.
